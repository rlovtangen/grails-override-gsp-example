Example of issue https://github.com/grails/grails-core/issues/9689

Start application:
....
cd myapp
./gradlew bootRun
....

Open http://localhost:8080/login/auth

Expects to see `auth.gsp` from myplugin, but sees `auth.gsp` from spring-security-core.

Then switch to branch `overrideInApp` and run application again.
This time you will see `auth.gsp` from application.
